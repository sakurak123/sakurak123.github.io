				<p>What is it like to be an artist, today?</p>

				<p>The purpose of  AUSTERITY PARTY PARTY is to create an artist built infrastructure based on reciprocity.</p>

				<p>
					<span>What that looks like as a publishing entity is to create an exchange between works</span>
					
					<img src="./assets/images/about/about_bush.webp" class="bush position-absolute text-wrap-left hide-desktop">

					<span> and its audiences that are based on the joy of being seen, sharing, and receiving an art experience. We are inspired by being witness to the transformation of an artistsâ€™ practice into books, workshops, programming and exhibitions.</span>
				</p>

				<p>
					<span>AUSTERITY PARTY PARTY was first</span>

					<img src="./assets/images/about/about_night.webp" class="night position-absolute text-wrap-right hide-desktop">

					<span> conceived between artists Sakura Sky Kelley and  Nic Dur inspired by a tradition of queer publishing and was formed together with artist Andre Bradley in 2024 with an expanding interest in amplifying the voices</span>

					<span> of cultural producers through publishing and curatorial practice. We are based in Joshua Tree, California, Philadelphia, and New York City. What unites us is our interest in photography and books for their radical potential to illuminate and disseminate ideas.</span>
				</p>

				<p>The purpose of this website is to archive and record our flexible, autonomous, collaborative, new style of gathering.</p>
